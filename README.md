# Industrial Competition 2017

Industrial Competition is a rally game for high school students held by Petra Christian University Industrial Engineering Department. This web application is used for the stage 2, where teams will simulate manufacturing process in a factory. The app keeps the teamsâ€™ data, resources, activities, and score.

I was the project leader and worked with 2 other developers. We collaborated with the committee to develop the database and the web app full-stack. We also installed the networking infrastructure and ran the app during the game.
